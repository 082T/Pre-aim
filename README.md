#### Info given:
```
> target location               - (x,y,z)
> target moving direction+speed - (x,y,z)
> your location                 - (x,y,z)
> your projectile speed         - x
```    
    all variables are "double"
    
#### Outputs the vector of a direction in which the projectile must be fired.

*All calculation is done in 3-dimensional real space.* <br/>
*Velocity is not taken into account.*

> AT = target location
> MD = Target moving direction+speed
> AF = your location
> AS = your projectile speed
